                        I showed up way too early to the show. Kode9 at Corsica studios, right off of Elephant & Castle in South London.

                        Wandering down Walworth road I stumbled into a nice McDonalds in a bad part of town, a shrine to hamburgers in the midst of degeneracy and unlucky hands dealt. I grab a cup of tea for about a pound and sit down. I was in no hurry, there wasn't much to do except nurse my cold as best as I could and wander around the streets until the show starts.

                        McDonalds has a special place in my heart. You could call it nostalgia, but it isn't fond nostalgia. It is nothing compared to the hiraeth of summers spent at my Grandparents' house. McDonalds was always there, it defaulted itself into a special corner of my mind the way that a beautiful actress's face in a forgettable movie is remembered when I smell a certain scent of dish soap.

                    McDonalds is an enigma in the sense that it permeates seemingly random aspects of my consciousness that should be fond of something more important, something with more substance. It has the same importance as finding your dusty old first generation iPod that only has The Police Greatest Hits albums on it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    McDonalds exists to me in the same sense that intimacy exists in my messed up psyche's intepretation of modern romance. I could be wrong, but, through my limited understanding of history that mostly consists of reading random historical articles on wikipedia when I can't sleep, sex before intimacy was prevalent for a while and in the modern world there existed a brief period (in relation to the actual scale of humans existing in the world) where intimacy came before sex. I'm sure in proto-writing societies there was lots of unconsensual, unromantic post-caveman sex going on, but I like to think that once the Stone-Bronze-Iron system era passed and we became civilized to some degree that we also started to develop some sort of intimacy. Even when you look at instances of Iron Age homes they have a charm to them, they aren't literal holes in the wall. They have nice stone walls and nice thatch (or thatch-adjacent) roofs. There is room to be sweet to each-other. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this age survival was obviously still key. Living another day to live another day. Being able to eat and keep a roof over your head was paramount, but I still like to think that something special started to take form. I think that around this time Neolithic and even late-Paleolithic humans began hold hands. It's weird to think that they were having sex before they held hands. I guess that's how it worked back then. It's kind of charming isn't it? Even to me today holding a girls hand seems better than having sex. I personally would trek across an ice shelf and slay the largest megafauna harassing my local village in order for even the slightest chance at holding a girls hand. She has had kids with me and other males from the tribe, but I am the only male who has had the honor of holding her hand.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From then on, we began holding hands before we had sex. This lasted for quite a while. I don't really know what went wrong, but now we don't really hold hands anymore. I don't know what stopped us from holding hands. When one thing is the thing and one thing isn't the thing anymore, the thing that isn't the thing is seen as taboo. We're in a post-sex society. Sex is everywhere, and there's nothing wrong with that, but I just want to hold someones hand. I feel a little bit lost, I just want to find my way home.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It's odd to say we're in a post-sex society and to also say that holding hands is taboo, but I simply mean that sex before everything else is trending downwards. I don't really know what we're trending towards, but I like to think that it's the revival of intimacy for my own sake.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The only comparison I can draw for my own sake is the reoccuring presence of McDonalds in our collective consciousness. Something that once solely existed as a paramount of speed and efficiency to fulfill our carnal desires is now seen as nostalgic. The world being partial to McDonalds is the world healing; the world is beginning to return to form, the world is beginning to hold hands again. What once existed solely for our primal needs now exists to entertain our emotions and remind us just how vapid the world we lived in before was. Luckily it doesn't have to be that way anymore, luckily we're living in a better world now. The world hasn't changed all that much yet, but a trend is all that is needed. A better day preceded by a good yesterday will only be followed by an increasingly better tomorrow.
