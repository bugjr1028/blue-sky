                        The date is 98.12.28. A humble, hazy stage is back-dropped by soft purple lighting. Five band members grace the stage.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The bass is supplied by Yuzuru Kashiwabara. Kin-Ichi Motegi is at the drums. Darts is on board with the lead guitar. Honzi fills in every gap available with her vast array of instruments such as keys, violin, rock-organ, melodica, and accordion to name a few.  Shinji Sato, lead singer and founding member of Fishmans, with his uniquely androgynous voice, prompts the Akasaka Blitz concertgoers with this simple question:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div style="font-size: 50px">
                    <i>"Are you feel good?"</i>
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div style="text-align: center">
                    Shinji's voice is rhetorical. It is a declaration that you will feel good.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A transient sense of no worries is the quintessential feeling of Fishmans.

                    The importance of this live-album recording lies in its many different facets. At the time of its recording, the date 98.12.28, the importance of the show was the fact that it was the last show that Yuzuru Kashiwabara, one of the members of the original line-up, was going to play with the group.

                    <br>
                    Kashiwabara's rock-steady bass-lines consistently anchored the group's sound in dub, their origin, and was distinctively a part of the unique Fishmans sound. The remainder of the original line-up that was in the group at the time of this recording was Yuzuru Kashiwabara, Kin-Ichi Motegi, and Shinji Sato.  As a whole the group with Shinji Sato, Kin-Ichi Motegi, and two of the newer supporting members, Darts and Honzi, were going to continue the legacy of Fishmans.

                    Fans of Fishmans, including myself, tend to consider this the golden age of Fishmans. They had released their most critically acclaimed studio recordings in Long Season and Uchū Nippon Setagaya. Their sound was complete and wholly unique.
