                        The date is 98.12.28. A humble, hazy stage is back-dropped by soft purple lighting. Five band members grace the stage.

                        The bass is supplied by Yuzuru Kashiwabara. Kin-Ichi Motegi is at the drums. Darts is on board with the lead guitar. Honzi fills in every gap available with her vast array of instruments such as keys, violin, rock-organ, melodica, and accordion to name a few.  Shinji Sato, lead singer and founding member of Fishmans, with his uniquely androgynous voice, prompts the Akasaka Blitz concertgoers with this simple question:

                        The importance of this live-album recording lies in its many different facets. At the time of its recording, the date 98.12.28, the importance of the show was the fact that it was the last show that Yuzuru Kashiwabara, one of the members of the original line-up, was going to play with the group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kashiwabara's rock-steady bass-lines consistently anchored the group's sound in dub, their origin, and was distinctively a part of the unique Fishmans sound. The remainder of the original line-up that was in the group at the time of this recording was Yuzuru Kashiwabara, Kin-Ichi Motegi, and Shinji Sato.  As a whole the group with Shinji Sato, Kin-Ichi Motegi, and two of the newer supporting members, Darts and Honzi, were going to continue the legacy of Fishmans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fans of Fishmans, including myself, tend to consider this the golden age of Fishmans. They had released their most critically acclaimed studio recordings in Long Season and Uchū Nippon Setagaya. Their sound was complete and wholly unique.

                        This in fact was the last time Fishmans ever performed live, with or without Yuzuru Kashiwabara.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Shinji Sato, the lead singer of Fishmans, passed away shortly after the concert on March 15th.

                        I truly wish I could properly divulge in the exceedingly dense history behind this group and I honestly feel that I am capable of doing it to the extent it deserves, but I want it to be done properly. I've managed to get a hold of nearly every record the band has put out on vinyl, every live DVD performance, every book written about the band, and almost every physical magazine appearance they've made.

                        I've had this collection for a couple years now and every time I attempt to tackle the monumental task of not only chronicling everything, I am impeded by a multitude of international language barriers and also the want to be certain with my writings.

                        There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding certain parts of this group, whether it's the cause of Shinji's death, the artists previous work before the band, or relationships among band members. Frankly, a lot of it is very interesting, but almost all of it ends up as gossip without any credible facts or sources since there is such a large barrier between the new American audience and the old Japanese audience. For the time being, since the time is right and special time in regards to the band has passed recently, I am going to speak about how this band has truly impacted me and how this band has made me rethink and look at other artists that impacted me in similar ways in the past. All of this is in hope of not only sharing the indescribable ethereal feeling that this band impressed upon me, but also building momentum and garnering interest towards continued writings about more of the technicalities behind the group.

                        There is something transcendental about certain musical releases. Everybody has one or a handful of releases that touches a special part of their mind. In the cliches of modern day, music is the soundtrack to certain parts of our lives. Definitive albums to your life are typically albums that define a very memorable part of your life. They are the perfect backdrop to a specific scenario based on what you are doing or going through. Most of the time these albums are brought out by the premise in which you find yourself in.

                        For me, I would skate every day with my friends back in my old hometown. The concrete dunes of southern California were ready to be tamed. Hills that were bombed were tamed and hills that broke bones were left alone, for we were the ones that had been tamed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Skaters in our group came and went, some skated once and some skated hundreds of times with us. Sometimes we skated in the day and sometimes we skated in the night, but most days we skated in the day and the night. Some days were designated solely to skating and nothing else, nourishment came second. On these days known as skate days we would skate the second we all got up until the sun went down and our legs could no longer take it. The only nourishment we had was whatever fast food restaurant happened to be at the bottom of the hill we most recently bombed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Those who stuck with skate day consistently became the core of our friend group, by no coincidence. This core group shared a very common bond and a large amount of shared time together allowed for a lot of our influences to rub off on each-other. We would all blast early emo and math rock albums while driving our first cars around the hills of our neighborhoods in between skate sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One friend introduced us to Cloud Nothings' Turning On. Years of skate days lived without the twinkly lo-fi indie musings of Cloud Nothings, but the second it entered our ears on one skate day, it permeated the very essence of skate day itself.  Turning On is skate day. Skate day is Turning On. There is no longer one without the other. The very testament to that itself is the fact that I am sitting on a couch in my grandparent's old home, writing this, longing to return home to visit old friends and skate again, and the first thing that comes to mind is the driving bass-line of the album's title track.

                        Skate days continued. Like any friend group people came and went. Friends went away to college and friends stayed in town for college. I stayed in town with the core friend group and continued skate days long into my early college career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day I got up and left. I transferred schools over halfway across the country. Skate days only continued when I came back to town and even then, they were never as frequent as before. I wasn't sad at the time that the monolith of consistency in my life known as skating had ceased so suddenly for it left its mark and never overstayed its welcome.

                        98.12.28 is transcendental and definitive. It is ethereal in every ounce of its sound and definitive in every shrill androgynous shriek of Shinji's voice. There truly is nothing like it. This would lend itself to being related to a definitive part of my life, but it doesn't. It is the only release that happens to be so utterly definitive that it goes beyond relating to one singular part of my life. It hadn't only written its one remark on one page of one chapter of my life, rather it stained every page from front to back with its ink. Turning On left a very definitive, clear remark on the skate day chapter of my life. Untrue  left a haunting, ghostly specter that follows me under the yellow streetlights as I walk at night. 98.12.28 is every moment in between and every moment that longs to be free of worry.
